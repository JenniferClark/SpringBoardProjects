    "\n",
    "This notebook is the starting point for the Smart School System.  \n",

    "the unified \"Golden Record\" for all school data used in the project.\n",

    "### Why this notebook is important\n",
    "- Establishes a **single, authoritative schema** before ingesting any real datasets.\n",
    "- Ensures all future data (NCES, CRDC, CA Private Directory, Montessori, IB, etc.)\n",
    "  can be merged cleanly into the same structure.\n",
    "- Creates a **small sample dataset** (3–5 schools) to test schema alignment,\n",
    "  column types, and basic transformations.\n",
    "- Prepares the foundation for later notebooks:\n",
    "  - Feature engineering (derived scores)\n",
    "  - Vectorization (ML-ready numeric features)\n",
    "  - School–child matching engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this notebook will produce\n",
    "- A finalized **schools_master_schema** (human-readable reference).\n",
    "- An empty Pandas DataFrame using all schema columns.\n",
    "- A few manually constructed sample school records.\n",
    "- Sanity checks to confirm the schema works in practice.\n",
    "- A saved sample dataset for use in the next notebook.\n",
